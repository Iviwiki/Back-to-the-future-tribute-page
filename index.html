                <li>At the beginning of the first film there is a shot of the clocks in Doc's house. One of the clocks foreshadows the end of the first film. </li>
                <li>Marty McFly shows up at the casting call for bands playing "The Power of Love" to play at the prom. The jury rejects them for being "noisy" and it is the song's author, Huey Lewis, who breaks the news. </li>
                <li>Doc meets Marty at Twine Pines Mall, which later and because Marty ran over one of Mr. Peabody's pine trees, will be renamed Lone Pine Mall.</li>
                <li>When Marty walks into the 80's cafe playing wild gunslinger, do you recognise this kid? That's Elijah Wood. </li>
                <li>Clayton Ravine, so called because Clara Clayton was supposed to die there, changes its name at the end of the trilogy to Eastwood Ravine, the fictional name for Martin McFly in the West. </li>
